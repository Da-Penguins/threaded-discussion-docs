Hello! Our group, Da-Penguins, is dedicated to creating open source projects to allow for a cheaper and easier way of using technology.

We are currently creating a “threaded-discussion” web component to facilitate discussion via comments and replies. This web component will be a discussion board where messages can be posted as replies or as new comments. A user will then be able to edit them and even delete them if necessary. Each thread will come with a UUID (universally unique identifier) in order to allow for embedding of the component.

_You can find the GitHub issue, with more specifics, here:_ https://github.com/elmsln/issues/issues/960.
